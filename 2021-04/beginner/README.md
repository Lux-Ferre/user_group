# Beginners' Challenge April 2021

You have 100 cats. 

You enjoy dressing them up - making them wear funny hats. 

## Scenario

You seat each of your cats on a chair in a circle. 

None of them is wearing a hat. 

You walk around the circle 100 times, each time starting at the first cat on a chair. 

On the first circuit you stop at every cat; on the second circuit at every second cat; on the third at every third cat and so on. 

If the cat at which you stop is wearing a hat, you take it off. If the cat has no hat, you put one on it. 

## The program

You are to write a Python programme to mimic the above scenario. 

At the end of it, it should print out a message in the following format. 

    Cat 1 is wearing a hat.
    Cat 7 is wearing a hat

    # and so on. 

 ## Guidance

 Think about how you mimic going around a fixed number of cats 100 times. How would you control it so that each time increasing the interval at which you stop at a cat?

 Think also how you would store the 'is wearing / is not wearing' for each cat. 

Have fun! 

## Bonus

Who can write the code in the fewest lines of code?
