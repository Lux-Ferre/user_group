# APUG January 2022 Beginner Challenge

This month we will work on the [same challenge](https://github.com/PythonAberdeen/user_group/blob/master/2022-01/intermediate/README.md) as the intermediate group - building Pyrdle - our own version of Wordle. 

Don't worry about completing the whole challenge during the evening (although you might want to keep working on it on your spare time).

Break it down into chunks and work on one or two of those. 

For example:

* picking a random word
* accepting a word and comparing it to our random word
* counting how many attempts the payer has had - and when it reaches six declaring the game over
* displaying symbols to indicate correct letters in correct positions, correct letters in worng positions, wrong letters

Good luck.

Please upload your solutions to this Github repo.
