# APUG March 2022 - Beginner Challenge

## Introduction

This group coding exercise follows the talk from Ian on using Python to query data from Wikidata. 

## The challenge

Using Python and Wikidata _only_ calculate who in the following list was tallest.

- Robert Mugabe
- Vladimir Lenin
- Adolf Hitler
- Vladimir Putin
- Josef Stalin

### Suggested approach

Create a query in [Wikidata Query Service](https://query.wikidata.org/) first. 

Think about the gender of the people in the list - how is that expressed in Wikidata?

Think about what _positions those people held_? You may need more than one. If you do, this item on [Ian's learning page about hospitals in two council areas](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Watty62/Learning#Hospitals) may help.

Once you have the query working, try it in Python MKWikidata. You can run it in a Jupyter notebook or using Pytcharm or VSCode etc.  

Once you have the data back in Python, how would you look for those names, compare their heights and store and print the tallest? 

## Bonus Challenge

- Can you retrieve and display the tallest one's photograph? (hint P18)
- Can you graph the top 10 leaders? 
- Can you amend your query to find the tallest female novellist or poet in Wikidata? 
- Or the shortest male film actor?
