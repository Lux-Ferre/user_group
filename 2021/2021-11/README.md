# Challenge

The challenge this month is more open ended than usual. 

The first step will be to get python 3.10 installed (if you don't already have it) to have access to the SPM feature. 

Then we are going to have a look at Guido van Rossum's [pattern matching examples](https://github.com/gvanrossum/patma/tree/master/examples). Want to figure out how they work, run them with the included examples to see that they produce the results we expect, try other inputs, and look at modifications or extensions we could make to them. 

`jsonpets.py` would be a good one to start with. Create other inputs to create different pets and to hit the error cases. Add another type of pet (and some input data to generate a pet of this type). 

`over.py` has a couple of examples of overloading functions to handle different inputs. Implement another function in this pattern (e.g. matrix and scalar multiplication).

`sqlite_tutorial.py` looks at some dataabase access. 

`expr.py` implements an expression parser. This one is a bit more complicated. `test_expr.py` has some unit tests for it that gives some details of what the different parts do.
