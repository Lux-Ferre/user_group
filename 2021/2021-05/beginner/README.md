# Beginners' Challenge May 2021

Write a function to tell if brackets (`()`, `[]`, `{}`) in a string are balanced or not:

```python
balanced("({[]})") => True
balanced("abc(def{g}hi[jk]((()))l)m") => True
balanced("a(b") => False
balanced("([)]") => False
```

This example is from [this list](https://gist.github.com/oskarkv/3168ea3f8d7530ccd94c97c19aafe266#balanced) of functional programming exercises. The others there are worth having a go at. There are links there to other's solutions.
