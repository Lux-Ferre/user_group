# words and numbers

Task this month is looking at converting numbers to words.

`skeleton.py` has an outline for the functions to convert in either
direction, and some test cases. The dummy implementations fail for
most of the tests. It would be a useful start to come with either
implementation from scratch.

`partial.py` has a partial implementation for `wordnumber()` but it
still fails for some of the included test cases.
 - figure out how it works
 - Fix the failing cases
 - Expand the tests to check other cases - can you find a better
   strategy than manually creating test cases?
