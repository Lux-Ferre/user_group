The objective is to write a small piece of code which presents a user with a phrase (for example, "She sells seashells by the seashore").
The user has to write the phrase as fast as possible,
Finally, the programme will show the user the elapsed time in which the phrase was written and the accuracy (how similar is the written phrase to the model one).

#Ideas for added challenge
#Offer the user different phrases
#Should it be case sensitive?
#Create a scoreboard: Ask users for their name and keep the attempts
#Create a score that averages speed and accuracy!
