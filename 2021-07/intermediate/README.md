## Intermediate Challenge

At a recent Code the City event one of the teams looked at what open data was being published by Scottish councils. 

We have a couple of python scripts and a C# program to get details of datasets from different systems (and some details gathered manually), a python notebook to merge the data from teh different sources and do some analysis of how the councils compare, and a render step that creates a page with a combined list of all the datasets. 

The code: https://github.com/CodeTheCity/the_od_bods

Rendered page: https://ormiret.github.io/the_od_bods/

There are quite a lot of issues with this code. Tickets for the identified issues: https://github.com/CodeTheCity/the_od_bods/issues

That is definitely not a complete list of things that could be fixed or improved. 

Want to work on one (or more) of those tickets (or other issues you can find). 

Create pull request(s) with your fixes or improvements.
