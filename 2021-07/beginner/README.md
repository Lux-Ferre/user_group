## Beginner Challenge

### Download Starter Code

This challenge will build upon existing code we have written for this exercise.

There are two version of the file (standard Python, and Jupyter), download the version you prefer to work on:

- [Standard Python Version](bank_program.py)
- [Jupyter Notebook Version](bank_program.ipynb)

### 1. Understanding the Code

The first task will be to examine the code and try to understand what it's doing.

This doesn't really mean reading it line by line. What are the methods that are defined? The global variables?

The main method (`main()` in the standard Python version, or the final cell in the Jupyter version) is the top level of the program. It will loop around until the variable `exit` is set. What does it do in this loop?

Try running the program to test it out.
