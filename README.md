# Aberdeen Python User Group

## Event Format

Our Aberdeen Python Group runs on the second Wednesday of every month. This will be fully online for now and we'll use Zoom as the platform.

Next Event: *Wednesday, 11th April 2022*, 6:30 pm to 9:00 pm

See our [website](https://pythonaberdeen.github.io) for more details and how to register. 

In this month's session, we will practice a "code kata".

"Code Kata is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software development. A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each. The intent behind code kata is similar. Each is a short exercise (perhaps 30 minutes to an hour long)." - [CodeKata.com](www.codekata.com)
