**Creating GUIs with PySimpleGUI - Mike Driscoll**

Learn how to create cross-platform GUIs using Python and PySimpleGUI. In this talk, you will learn the basics of PySimpleGUI, and Mike will also show you how to access great demos and show a couple of small applications.

Mike, who will join us live from Iowa, USA, has been a Python developer for over a decade. He has been writing about Python for many years on his blog, The Mouse vs the Python. He has recently restarted his Python Youtube channel too. His readers got him interested in writing books about Python and now Mike has ten books published! You can find Mike on Twitter at https://twitter.com/driscollis.

## Group Activities

After the talks we will have group coding challenges based on using PySimpleGui to build a small application.
