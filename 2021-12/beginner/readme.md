# Beginners Challenge 08 Dec 2021

For this month's begginer's challenge we will use [http://adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com)

If you haven't done so, register to use the site using either GitHub, Google, Twitter or Reddit. 

You'll then have access to the daily puzzles. 

This evening, we'll start with day 1 (1st December).

Each day has two challenges. To do the second you have to solve the first and submit the correct answer. We'll aim to finish the two puzzles for the 1st December. 

Then you can catch up with other day's challenges at home!
