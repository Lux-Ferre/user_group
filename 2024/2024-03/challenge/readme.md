# Aberdeen Python User Group 13 March 2024

Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook from Ian's talk tonight for an introduction to web scraping and some of the fundamental libraries to use. 

## Challenge

### Option 1

Pick a school from the list below. Have a look at the branded school uniform supplier(s). Ttry to scrape the items offered - with a description and cost per item.

|School |Supplier|
|---|---|
|Bucksburn Academy |https://www.pomprintdesigns.co.uk/?store-page=Bucksburn-Academy-c109628745   |
|Lochside Academy   |https://www.pomprintdesigns.co.uk/?store-page=Longside-School-c109697268   |
|St Machar Academy   |https://www.pomprintdesigns.co.uk/?store-page=St-Machar-Academy-c109628746   |


### Option 2

Choose a non-branded supplier from the list below. Try to scrape a list of items and costs. 

* [Asda](https://direct.asda.com/george/school-uniform/D10,default,sc.html)
* [Sainsburys](https://tuclothing.sainsburys.co.uk/browse/school-uniform/c:842024/)
* [Tesco](https://www.tesco.com/zones/clothing/school-uniform 

)
* 
## Additional

If you manage to scrape the data, think about how you would save it (eg in a file with the date, supplier name, school - if appropriate etc)

And .... 

At [CTC31 - Democracy Hackathon](https://codethecity.org/ctc31) this coming weekend there will be a challenge around web scraping to assist the University of Aberdeen with a research project into the cost of school uniforms.
