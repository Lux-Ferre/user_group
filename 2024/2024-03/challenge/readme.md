# Aberdeen Python User Group 13 March 2024

Please refer to the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/PythonAberdeen/talks/blob/master/2024-Mar/Scraping%20with%20Python.ipynb) from Ian's talk tonight for an introduction to web scraping and some of the fundamental libraries to use. 

## Challenge

### Option 1

Pick a school from the list below. Have a look at the online shops of suppliers of branded school uniform items. Try to scrape the items offered - with a description and cost per item.

|School |Supplier|
|---|---|
|Bucksburn Academy |https://www.pomprintdesigns.co.uk/?store-page=Bucksburn-Academy-c109628745   |
|Lochside Academy   |https://www.pomprintdesigns.co.uk/?store-page=Longside-School-c109697268   |
|St Machar Academy   |https://www.pomprintdesigns.co.uk/?store-page=St-Machar-Academy-c109628746   |

Given that the supplier listed for each is the same, how easy is it to combine these into one scraper? 

### Option 2

Alternatively, choose the supplier of non-branded uniform items from the list below. Try to scrape a list of items and costs. 

* [Asda](https://direct.asda.com/george/school-uniform/D10,default,sc.html)
* [Sainsburys](https://tuclothing.sainsburys.co.uk/browse/school-uniform/c:842024/)
* [Tesco](https://www.tesco.com/zones/clothing/school-uniform)

### Upload your code
Clone this repo, and add your suggested solutions to the / solutions directory. Make a pull request and we'll add it to the repo.

## Additional

If you manage to scrape the data, think about how you would save it (eg in a file with the date, supplier name, school - if appropriate etc)

And .... 

At [CTC31 - Democracy Hackathon](https://codethecity.org/ctc31) this coming weekend there will be a challenge around web scraping to assist the University of Aberdeen with a research project into the cost of school uniforms.
