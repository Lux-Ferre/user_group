# Challenge 1: FizzBuzz

**Description:**

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

**Example Output:**
<pre>
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
</pre>

**Hint:** Use the modulo operator `%` to determine if a number is divisible by another number.

# Challenge 2: Palindrome Checker

**Description:**

Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

**Example Input:**
<pre>
"Madam"
"Goody"
"I am Mai"
</pre>

** Example Output:**
<pre>
True
False
True
</pre> 

**Hint:** Use string methods like `.lower()` and `.replace()` to preprocess the string before checking for palindromes.

# Challenge 3: Sum of Even Numbers

**Description:**

Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given list of integers.

**Example Input:**

[11,12,33,19,82,101]

** Example Output:**

94


**Hint:** Use a loop to iterate through the list and an `if` statement to check if a number is even.
