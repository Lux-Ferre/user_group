# Challenge 1: Anagram Checker

**Description:**

Write a program that checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example Input:**

String 1: "listen"
String 2: "silent"

**Example Output:**

String 3: "Netherlands"
String 4: "Neanderthals"

**Example Output:**
False


**Hint:** Use sorting or a dictionary to compare the frequency of each character in both strings.

# Challenge 2: Prime Factorization

**Description:**

Write a program that performs prime factorization of a given integer. The program should return a list of prime factors in ascending order.

**Example Input:**
56

**Example Output:**

[2, 2, 2, 7]

**Example Input:**
45

**Example Output:**

[3,3,5]
