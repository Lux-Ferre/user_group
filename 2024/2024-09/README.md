# BINGO

Numbers on a bingo card are not randomly distributed. Each column has a subset of the full range of numbers that can be in it.

Here we're looking at 75 ball (US) BINGO.

Labelling the 5 columns B, I, N, G and O: "B" can have 5 numbers from the range 1–15, "I" 5 numbers from the range 16–30, "N" 4 numbers from the range 31–45 (the centre square in the card is always a free spot), "G" 5 numbers from 46–60, and "O" 5 numbers from 61–75.

Make a function to generate BINGO cards.

## Side quest: testing

Write some tests to verify that your function is producing valid BINGO cards.

How could you verify/prove/check that your produced BINGO cards are fair?

## Side quest: printing

Make printable versions of your BINGO cards.

What could you add to the cards to allow you to verify that a card was one generated by you and not from someone sneaking in their own (possibly generated after seeing what numbers come up if they brought a printer)?

## Side quest: 90 ball (UK) bingo cards

90 ball BINGO cards follow different rules.

Make a function to generate them.

## Side quest: webapp to play BINGO

Present a generated BINGO card to the user and let them click on numbers to mark them off.

This could work with pyodide to allow the logic to run in the browser. Or a web server to hold the state. Or the state could be serialised and stored in a cookie sent to the client (how would you protect it against possible tampering on the client side?). Or what other ideas have you got?

# Rows vs Columns

Apparently rows are ~3x more likely than columns as winning lines in a game of BINGO.

Simulate some (many?) games of BINGO and see if that is the result you get.

## Side quest: statistics

Calculate the probability distribution for the "real" ratio between rows and columns from the results you're getting from simulated games.

How does it change with simulating more games?

What is the smallest number of simulated games you can run to have 95% confidence your ratio is correct ±0.1? Or ±0.01?

Plot the number of simulated games (and run time for your simulator) against accuracy of result.
