# Intermediate challenge August 2020

Using the tools and frameworks in the talk tonight, and using ONLY web scraping: 

1. Get the population of one of the cities in the list below. 
2. If you have time, scrape all of them. 
3. And if still have time to spare, add them together. 

Where there are multiple instances of population for a city, for this exercise, use the first one your scraper finds.

- Perth: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth,_Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth,_Scotland )
- Edinburgh: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh )
- Glasgow: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow ) 
- Aberdeen: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen)
- Stirling :[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling) 
- Inverness: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverness) 
- Dundee: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundee)

A useful mnemonic for remembering them is PEGASID - which is the name of a meteor shower.
