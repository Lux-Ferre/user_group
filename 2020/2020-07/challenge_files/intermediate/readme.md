# Intermediate Challenge

## The Challenge

Today’s intermediate challenge is an exercise in **social coding** and involves the following project:

[PythonAberdeen/hangman](https://github.com/PythonAberdeen/hangman) (available during the event)

This project is a game of “Hangman”, written in Python.

But it’s not the best code. It has a number of issues. Here's the GitHub issue page:

[PythonAberdeen/hangman/issues](https://github.com/PythonAberdeen/hangman/issues)

Your task is to improve this project!

Improving could mean: fixing bugs, adding features, refactoring and tidying code, writing tests, writing documentation, or anything else.

## How to Contribute

Click "Fork" at the top-right of the project page. This will create a fork of the project in your own GitHub account.

Make your improvements on your fork, we suggest using GitHub Desktop (or the git command line) to clone your fork to your computer, and work there, then push the commit back up to your fork.

When you have made an improvement to the project, **submit a pull request** to have your changes merged into the upstream repo.

Remember to comment something like "fixes #1" (where 1 is replaced by the issues number) in the pull request description to tag that issue, this will close the issue automatically whne your pull request is merged.

If others are working on the project, you will probably encounter merge conflicts! The best thing to do is to merge from the origonal repo to your fork before you create a pull request. That way, you can resolve the conflicts locally, and the pull request can be merged automatically.
