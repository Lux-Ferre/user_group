# League tables
This month its all about making and showing league tables from user input. 

## Get the data
1. Prompt the user for 
 - Team name
 - League (1 or 2 only)
 - Number of points

 Once they have given those three items, start on Team again ..... 

 2. The prompt should allow them to type stop at any time a team name is asked for (but once a team name is answered they have to input the league and points).

## Displaying the data

 3. When the user types 'stop' you should print 
```
 >> Constructing our leagues 
 >>
```

 The printout should resemble this:
```
 >> League 1
 >> =========
 >> <Team name> <points>
 >> <Team name> <points>
 >> <Team name> <points>
```
 etc

## Sorting the data

 Try to organise the leagues by descending points
```
 >> <Team A> 51
 >> <Team B> 42
 >> <Team C> 28 
```
 etc

## Plan your approach

 Before you start coding, plan out 
 - how you are going to check users data (text v numeric etc)
 - how you will store the data,
 - how you will separate the two leagues
 - how you will order by points

 This will inform your choice of data structures to use. 

It is best if you do the exercise in small groups. Discuss design decisions, and share programming approaches. 

Don't forget to upload your code to this Github repo when you are finished.
