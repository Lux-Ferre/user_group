          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Why are any of us here?</p>
            <p>We will leave aside the existential parts of why anything matters and focus in on:</p>
            <p>Why would you use async?</p>
            <p>Lets python programs do something elese while waiting</p>
            <p>Why I wanted to talk about it: async has changed over the years/languages. This was an excuse to spend some time getting it straight in my head. Hopefully Ive got enough understanding now that I can explain it. We are about to find out if that is actually the case.</p>
            <p>Might be quite a short talk - theres not that much to overall concepts of async. Devil is in the details. How long this goes on for will depend on if (or how often) I head off down rabbit hole of some detail. </p>
            <p>I think what I'm going to tell you is now the right way to do things, but that has changed a bit in the last few python versions other documentations might have different ways. Or you might be used to different ways if you learned this before current versions</p>

            <p>For non-programming analogy of async vs synchronous processing</p>
            <p>Stolen from talk by Miguel Grinberg at Pycon 2017.</p>
            <p>Chess grandmaster playing exhibition matches against players who are not as good as they are</p>
            <p>Say Grandmaster needs to think for 5 seconds before moving - oponents 55 seconds</p>
            <p>So 1 minute for each pair of moves</p>
            <p>If 30 pairs of moves per game, each game would be 30 minutes</p>
            <p>If play the games synchronously: 2 games/hour</p>
            <p>But grandmaster is mostly just waiting for other player to move</p>
            <p>They could play multiple games at the same time: if its still 5 seconds/move for them then could make moves in 11 other games and get back to first game as opponent makes their move.</p>
            <p>Would then be 24 games/hour</p>
            <p>Would be cost of context switch</p>

          <h1>Parallelism</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>async is about concurrent tasks not parallel execution</p>
            <p>Zoomed out there can be multiple tasks existing at the same time and they can all be making progress</p>
            <p>But at fine grain only 1 task will actually be executing at a time</p>
            <p>Swap around which one that is</p>
            <p>Single operating system thread/process python runtime executes all async tasks</p>

          <h1 class="r-fit-text">Cooperative</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>tasks choose when they give up control for other tasks to run</p>
            <p>Can simplify code a lot as no need for locking for parallel access to shared resources</p>
            <p>No cost of OS context switch (though there are still async context switches)</p>
            <p>One task running for a long time without giving up control will block other tasks</p>

          <h1 class="r-fit-text">I/O</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Mostly useful for I/O</p>
            <p>Right there in the name of main module: asyncio</p>
            <p>Can also be used for control loop where processing might happen on other cores (esp. if that is calling out to some non-python lib)</p>
            <p>Even if completely CPU bound and do not want to spread over multicores async can be useful to split different processing into different tasks to make it easier for people to follow</p>
